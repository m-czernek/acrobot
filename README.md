# Acrobot

Acrobot is a Google Hangouts chat bot, with the aim of keeping track
of acronyms used within the company.

## Usage

Acrobot is capable of multiple actions:

* Saving an acronym: `!acronym = explanation`
* Getting an acronym explanation: `acronym`
* Modifying an acronym explanation: `!acronym = explanation => new explanation`
* Removing an acronym explanation: `!acronym = explanation =>`

White spaces do not matter. If you are interacting with acrobot in a room,
do not forget to tag the bot, e.g. `@Acrobot !acronym = explanation`.

You can change and remove only those explanations that you entered into the
database.

## Architecture

Acrobot is a simple application, using:

* Java (tested against OpenJDK 11)
* Hibernate
* MySQL
* Kubernetes/OpenShift for deployment #todo OCP template

This particular implementation uses Google's [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview)
messaging middleware.

As such, before deploying the Google bot, you have to complete Google's
Pub/Sub prerequisites:

1. Create a project in the Cloud Platform Console, which:
    1. Has the **Pub/Sub API** enabled.
    1. Has granted the Pub/Sub permissions to the **chat-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com** service role.
1. Create a service account with the **Pub/Sub API** roles.
1. Create a message queue in the Cloud Platform Console.
1. Associate the queue with a subscription in the Cloud Platform Console.

For more details on setting up the bot, see the [Google Developer's documentation](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/how-tos/pub-sub).

Acrobot has a few dependencies:

1. export **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS**: an environment variable that contains the path to the service account json
you created. If you are deploying Acrobot on Kubernetes/OpenShift, you will have to inject the file either using a secret, or a config map, into your pod.
1. export **JDBC_URL**, **JDBC_USER**, and **JDBC_PASSWORD** for the DB connection details.
1. export **PROJECT_ID** and **SUBSCRIPTION_ID** which match your Google project and subscription created earlier.

## Testing

Acrobot contains unit tests with an in-memory H2 database. You should execute all tests before pushing new code.
You can execute tests by issuing: `mvn clean test`. To execute a particular test, you can specify the `test`
parameter in the format of `ClassName#TestName`, for example:
 
 `mvn clean test -Dtest=MessageHelperTest#exceptionPropagationTest`

All new features should have tests.

The idea of Acrobot came from a number of very smart folks at Red Hat. The IRC implementation was done by https://github.com/mfojtik. If you wish to run AcroBot on IRC, see the [AcroBot Implementation](https://github.com/theacrobot/AcroBot).
